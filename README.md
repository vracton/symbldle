**Symbldle** is a Wordle-like game where you try to figure out the day's SF Symbol!

controls:
- keyboard to write a character
- `space` to submit your current word
- `tab` to submit the first autocorrect word

tips:
- not all roots have enough modifiers to fill a row (for example, `a.circle.fill` can not be submitted for a 4 word long symbol)
- make sure you scroll down so the sutocomplete list is visible
